# scorebug
This is a baseball TV scorebug built with Java. The background is green (mostly green... changed a little for troubleshooting)
so it can be easily removed in a TV production environment. 

I've only tested this program on Mac comptuers, so I'm not sure if it works on a PC, but in theory it should.

The current version on github works, but the "full box score" mode isn't fully implemented. I'm hoping to build that using Inning classes. That way the user could change the number of innings and the graphic would adjust accordingly. Clicking the 
"full box score" mode in this unfinished version reveals some of those Inning classes as floating graphics. 

The point of this program is to output the graphic in the lower left of the window to TV. The user interface is in the top
part of the window and is not intended for broadcast. In a production environment the green background can be chromakey'd,
and the top part of the window can be cropped.

Message me with questions or concerns. Thanks.
